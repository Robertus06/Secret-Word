# Secret-Word
The whole project has been developed using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it is an application to computerize the narrator of the game Little Secret and be able to play the whole group of friends without anyone being left out. No framework or canva has been used. The entire application has been designed with CSS and the logic has been developed by handling the DOM with JavaScript, creating and removing HTML elements dynamically.
